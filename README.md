Most of the work in this repository is tbd, however we wil use alot of open source when possible and redistribute under the MIT license with the original content owner's permission.


Here is a brief synopsis of the project itself:
AI Algorithm Synopsis

	For the purpose of this algorithm we will create an algorithm that experiences time in a linear fashion, but also can have a list of variables through which it is the object of the algorithm to normalize. 


For example:

	The algorithm measures Extrovert/Introvert and Curiosity/Boredom on a scale of 1-100, naturally over time the algorithm trends towards 0. Through Genetic Programming (trial/error on a massive scale) it is the responsibility of the algorithm to increase this number. So when a user signs on to a Chatbot connected to the AI. It is able to talk to the user thus increasing it’s Extrovert value and increasing its curiosity value, both of which are therefore measured and important to the algorithm. Now what is important is that as soon as the user stops talking to the chatbot the algorithm starts decrementing those values. Boredom would increase as well as Introvert to the dismay of the algorithm. Thus the next time a user signs on the chatbot will make an attempt to get their attention because it knows if it interacts with the user 2 metrics against which it is measured increase.


Ideally we create a “Happy” state where the algorithm feels useful, engaged, and helpful. By plugging this algorithm into multiple stimulus [Chatbot, Speech Recognition/Text to Speech, Object Recognition, etc…] to increase the amount of stimulus the algorithm can get.

Note: How should the algorithm handle interrupts in the program?


One key point should be learning as well. How can we allow the algorithm to learn new methods of inducing or expressing stimuli both positive and negative. This will be the same as you would handle a 1 year old kid, however it is important for the AI algorithm to be able to express itself so it can learn where the boundaries are.

Personality Baseline

It would be important for the above factors to trend towards a personal baseline absent external stimuli. By adjusting this baseline you could make different types of AI.
