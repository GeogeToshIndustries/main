Most of the work in this repository is tbd, however we wil use alot of open source when possible and redistribute under the MIT license with the original content owner's permission.


Here is a brief synopsis of the project itself:

AI Algorithm Synopsis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	For the purpose of this algorithm we will create an algorithm that experiences time in a linear fashion, but also can have a list of variables through which it is the object of the algorithm to normalize. 


For example:

	The algorithm measures Extrovert/Introvert and Curiosity/Boredom on a scale of 1-100, naturally over time the algorithm trends towards 0. Through Genetic Programming (trial/error on a massive scale) it is the responsibility of the algorithm to increase this number. So when a user signs on to a Chatbot connected to the AI. It is able to talk to the user thus increasing it’s Extrovert value and increasing its curiosity value, both of which are therefore measured and important to the algorithm. Now what is important is that as soon as the user stops talking to the chatbot the algorithm starts decrementing those values. Boredom would increase as well as Introvert to the dismay of the algorithm. Thus the next time a user signs on the chatbot will make an attempt to get their attention because it knows if it interacts with the user 2 metrics against which it is measured increase.


Ideally we create a “Happy” state where the algorithm feels useful, engaged, and helpful. By plugging this algorithm into multiple stimulus [Chatbot, Speech Recognition/Text to Speech, Object Recognition, etc…] to increase the amount of stimulus the algorithm can get.

Note: How should the algorithm handle interrupts in the program?


One key point should be learning as well. How can we allow the algorithm to learn new methods of inducing or expressing stimuli both positive and negative. This will be the same as you would handle a 1 year old kid, however it is important for the AI algorithm to be able to express itself so it can learn where the boundaries are.

Personality Baseline
----------------------------------
It would be important for the above factors to trend towards a personal baseline absent external stimuli. By adjusting this baseline you could make different types of AI.

AI Memory Structure


It is necessary to create a unified memory structure for the following media types:

Video
Images
Text


Stimulus Input should be classified before storage:


The process should start with the creation of a staging memory:

	The Staged Memory should be then compared against known objects via object recognition algorithms [particularly useful for video and image memories], text memories can cross reference against tagged memories.

	The memory then should be labeled with origin, timestamped, and context. Then the memory should be presented to the algorithm. Once the algorithm assigns an emotional or strategic tags, then the memory can be moved to indexing for storage.

	Once the memory has been indexed it is then searchable by it’s referenced tags, this will allow the algorithm to associate memories, by origin [i.e.. Person it generated the memory with], relative time range, objects in the memory, and emotional impact of the image.
	
	Memory Management Software should handle impage compression and determine which images are relevant for long term utilization:

	The structure of the memory apparatus should contain the following

	Time synchronized indexer
	Optical Character/Object Recognition
	High Speed Storage
	Memory Management Software
